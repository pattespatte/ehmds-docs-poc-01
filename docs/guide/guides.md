# Guides

Here you will find guides for working with the EHM Design System.

## Design Principles

The EHM Design System is built on the following principles:

### 1. Accessibility First

All components are designed with accessibility in mind. We follow WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines and ensure our components are usable for everyone.

### 2. Consistency

Use the same components in the same way throughout your application. This creates a consistent and predictable user experience.

### 3. Simplicity

Our components are simple to use and understand. We avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on what's important.

## Color Usage

### Primary Color

Use the primary dark blue color (`hsla(228, 46%, 48%, 1)`) for:
- Primary buttons
- Links
- Active states
- Accent color

### Secondary Color

Use the secondary light blue color (`hsla(219, 29%, 53%, 1)`) for:
- Hover states
- Secondary interactive elements

## Typography

### Headings

Use **Roboto Slab** for main headings (H1). This creates a clear visual hierarchy.

### Body Text

Use **Noto Sans** for all body text. It's a readable font that works well on all screen sizes.

## Component Selection

### When should I use a button?

Use buttons for:
- Actions that save, submit, or delete data
- Navigation to a new page
- Triggering a modal or dialog

Use links for:
- Navigation to another page
- Fetching more information

### When should I use a card?

Use cards for:
- Grouping related content
- Presenting information in a scannable format
- Creating clickable panels

## Best Practices

1. **Use only one primary button per view** - This helps the user focus on the most important action
2. **Provide clear labels** - Avoid generic labels like "OK" or "Done"
3. **Test on real devices** - Ensure your components work on different screen sizes
4. **Write clear text** - Use simple and clear language
